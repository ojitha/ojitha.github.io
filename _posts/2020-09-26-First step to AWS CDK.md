First, you have to verify that, you have installed the AWS CDK.
1. in the macOS, install AWS CLI using Homebrew
2. install NodeJS
3. install AWS CDK using NodeJS

As explained in the [Python my workflow](https://ojitha.blogspot.com/2020/05/python-my-workflow.html), 

1. install Python version 3 
2. create virtual enviroment `p3` using pyenv tool 
3. You can use any directory to creat your scripts, I use Visual Studio Code as my editor
4. In case, I can use the following command to set the shell to python version 3:

```bash
pyenv shell p3
```
