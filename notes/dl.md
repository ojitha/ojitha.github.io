## Introcution

Deep learning performs ML tasks using Deep Neural Network(DNN). Artificial Neuron Network (ANN) is a vital element in all the models in DL.

## Linear Algebra for ML

What is Linear Algebra?

If it has an exponential term, it isn't linear algebra such as $2x^2+5 = 13$ or $2\sqrt{x}+6=13$. There can be 3 solutions in linear algebra:

1. one solution
2. no solution
3. infinite solution

In a given system, there could be many equations and many unknowns as $y=a+bx_{1}+cx_{2}+\ldots +mx_{n}$.
