## LLMs

Language Models use statistical methods to predict the succession of next tokens in a text sequence.

There are such a several neural networks:

1. Recurrent neural networks (RNN)
2. Convolutional neural networks (CNN)
3. **Transformer-base models**

Transformer-based LLMs are the standard in LLM because of their 

- parallelization capabilities and 
- effectiveness in handling long-range dependencies in text.
