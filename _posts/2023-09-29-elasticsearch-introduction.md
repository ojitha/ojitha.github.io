## Install

In this post, I have used Docker to install ElasticSearch. This has minimised the effort of getting started. Here the docker-compose.yml file taken from a official article[^2]:

```yaml
version: "3.8"


volumes:
 certs:
   driver: local
 esdata01:
   driver: local
 kibanadata:
   driver: local

networks:
 default:
   name: elastic
   external: false


services:
 setup:
   image: docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:${STACK_VERSION}
   volumes:
     - certs:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs
   user: "0"
   command: >
     bash -c '
       if [ x${ELASTIC_PASSWORD} == x ]; then
         echo "Set the ELASTIC_PASSWORD environment variable in the .env file";
         exit 1;
       elif [ x${KIBANA_PASSWORD} == x ]; then
         echo "Set the KIBANA_PASSWORD environment variable in the .env file";
         exit 1;
       fi;
       if [ ! -f config/certs/ca.zip ]; then
         echo "Creating CA";
         bin/elasticsearch-certutil ca --silent --pem -out config/certs/ca.zip;
         unzip config/certs/ca.zip -d config/certs;
       fi;
       if [ ! -f config/certs/certs.zip ]; then

```

As shown in the above, password is `changeme` for Kibana.

To setup run the docker compose command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

This will create three volumes as follows:

![Docker volumes](/assets/images/2023-09-29-elasticsearch-introduction/CleanShot 2023-09-29 at 20.59.07@2x.jpg)

If you want to access Elasticsearch API, you need to first copy certifcate to temp directory. To get the file first find the name of the Elasticsearch container.

![Find Elasticsearch container name](/assets/images/2023-09-29-elasticsearch-introduction/CleanShot 2023-09-29 at 21.01.36@2x.jpg)

In the above diagram <span style="color:white;background-color:red">‚ù∑</span> shows the container name. Copy the cert file to the temp directory:

```bash
docker cp elastic_es01_1:/usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs/ca/ca.crt /tmp/.
```

To test run the following command in the same host where docker instances are running:

```bash
curl --cacert /tmp/ca.crt -u elastic:changeme https://localhost:9200
```

It should give you the result:

```json
{
  "name" : "es01",
  "cluster_name" : "docker-cluster",
  "cluster_uuid" : "p2gzCZh9TYeW8WBGJOaNXw",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "8.7.1",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "docker",
    "build_hash" : "f229ed3f893a515d590d0f39b05f68913e2d9b53",
    "build_date" : "2023-04-27T04:33:42.127815583Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "9.5.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "7.17.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "7.0.0"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

To access the Kibana, use the follow url `http://<host ip>:5601` from anywhere.

To check the health of the cluster:

```bash
curl --cacert ca.crt -u elastic:changeme https://localhost:9200/_cluster/health
```

Or in Kibana

```
GET _cluster/health
```

To enable trial version:

```
POST /_license/start_trial?acknowledge=true
```



## CURD

You can create index as follows:

```
PUT fruits
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 3, 
    "number_of_replicas": 2
  }
}
```

To get the details of the `fruits` index:

```
GET fruits/_settings
```

Add documents:

```
POST fruits/_doc
{
  "name":"Mango",
  "qty": 2
  
}
```

### Add

The `POST` will add the `_id` automatically.

If you use `PUT`, you need to provide the document id as follows:

```
PUT fruits/_doc/1
{
  "name":"Mango",
  "qty": 2
  
}
```

> Warning: The `_doc` endpoing will overwrite the existing document.

Get the added document:

```
GET fruits/_search
```

output

```json
{
  "took": 444,
  "timed_out": false,
  "_shards": {
    "total": 3,
    "successful": 3,
    "skipped": 0,
    "failed": 0
  },
  "hits": {
    "total": {
      "value": 2,
      "relation": "eq"
    },
    "max_score": 1,
    "hits": [
      {
        "_index": "fruits",
        "_id": "i7dcWosBlpsdZwgSyFwT",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "name": "Mango",
          "qty": 2
        }
      },
      {
        "_index": "fruits",
        "_id": "1",
        "_score": 1,
        "_source": {
          "name": "Mango",
          "qty": 2
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

To get the document by id

```
GET fruits/_doc/1
```

To avoid rewrite existing document use `create` endpoint.

For example above following `PUT` will generate error:

```
PUT fruits/_create/1
{
  "name":"Mango",
  "qty": 3
  
}
```

This will generate 409 error message.

### Update

To update only the quantity of the above document:

```
POST fruits/_update/1
{
  "doc":{
    "qty": 3
  }
}
```

Here, used the `_update` endpoin.

### Delete

How to delete a document:

```
DELETE fruits/_doc/1
```



## Search

When search query is sent, Elasticsearch retrieves **relevant** documents.

| Index                  | ![CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.25.09@2x](./assets/images/2023-09-29-elasticsearch-introduction/CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.25.09@2x.png) |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| True & False Possitves | ![CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.29.30@2x](./assets/images/2023-09-29-elasticsearch-introduction/CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.29.30@2x.png) |
| True & False Negatives | ![CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.30.45@2x](./assets/images/2023-09-29-elasticsearch-introduction/CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.30.45@2x.png) |
| Precision              | ![CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.35.44@2x](./assets/images/2023-09-29-elasticsearch-introduction/CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.35.44@2x.png) |
| Recall                 | ![CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.37.42@2x](./assets/images/2023-09-29-elasticsearch-introduction/CleanShot 2023-10-23 at 14.37.42@2x.png) |

Precision: What portion of the retrieved data is actually relevant to the search query.

Recall: What portion of relevant data is being returned as search results.

Precision and Recall are inversely related.

More relevant document are higher the score. The score is a value that represents how relevant a document is to that specific query as well as Elasticsearch compute the score for each document for that hit. To score, Elasticsearch uses TF/IDF.

## Mapping

Index mapping is a process of defining how a document must be mapped in the search engine. Along with the data type, mapping allows you to set the field characteristics such as searchable, returnable, sortable, how to store, date format, whether the strings must be treated as full text fields, and so on.

### Dynamic Mapping

When you create a document for the first time, Elasticsearch creates an index as well as the mapping schema based on the document's field values. This type of mapping is called *dynamic mapping*. 

![create index from a document](/assets/images/2023-09-29-elasticsearch-introduction/create index from a document.jpg)

Get mapping details of specific property:

```
GET students/_mapping/field/name.first.keyword
```

Get without source

```
GET students/_doc/1?_source=false
```

To get multiple documents as the same time

```
GET students/_mget
{
  "ids":[1,2,3]
}
```

if you want to avoid missing one

```
GET students/_search
{
  "query": {
    "ids": {
      "values": [1,2,3]
    }
  }
}
```



for the doc

```
PUT students/_doc/2
{
  "name":"Josh",
  "subjects": ["Maths","English"]
}
```

Query

```
GET students/_source/2
```

output

```
{
  "name": "Josh",
  "subjects": [
    "Maths",
    "English"
  ]
}
```

Only for the name

```
GET students/_source/2/?_source_includes=name
```

output

```
{
  "name": "Josh"
}
```

For the document

```
PUT students/_doc/2
{
  "name":{
    "first":"Josh",
    "last": "JoshLastName"
  },
  "subjects": ["Maths","English"]
}
```

Get only the nested last name of the source

```
GET students/_source/2/?_source_includes=name.last
```

To only update the nested last name:

```
POST students/_update/2
{
  "doc":{
    "name":{
      "last": "Brown"
    }
  }
}
```

### Explicit Mapping

You can define explicit mapping at an index level[^5].

- String: You can save a string field as of type, `text` or `keyword`. 
    - The `text` type is used to index full-text values, such as the description of a product. These fields are analyzed by an analyzer to convert the string into a list of individual terms before being indexed. 
    - The `keyword` field type is used for structured content such as IDs, email addresses, hostnames, status codes, or zip codes, and the entire content of the field is indexed and searched as one unit.
- Numeric: You can use the numeric field types to define fields that are holding numeric data. The various numeric field types supported includes 
    - long, 
    - integer, 
    - short, 
    - byte, 
    - double, 
    - float.
- Date: A field to hold a date type can be defined using the `date` type. This field can hold formatted date strings.
- Boolean: This field accepts the JSON values `true` and `false`. But, can also accept strings that are interpreted as either `true` or `false`.
- Object: You can use this field type for fields consisting of JSON objects, which can contain subfields.
- Arrays: This is a `nested` field type can be used for arrays of objects to be indexed in a way that they can be queried independently of each other.

#### Characteristics

You can group the field types under one or more of the following characteristics:

- Searchable: A searchable field is one which is indexed and the document containing the field can be searched and retrieved by the value of the field. The behavior of a searchable field varies based on whether the field is defined as `analyzed` or `non-analyzed`.
- Returnable: A returnable field is one which is stored and the field value can be returned as part of the search response.
- Sortable: A sortable field is one, based on which the search results can be sorted in a particular order, either `desc` or `asc`. The search results can be ordered by one or more sortable fields.

## Common Data types

None text-analysis process are ideal candidates for the `keyword` data type. Elasticsearch supports dates by providing a `date` type as well as additional options to format dates. Define a format of your own choosing, say you want to set `open_day` in UK format ("dd-MM-yyyy")

```
"open_day":{
  "type": "date",
  "format":"dd-MM-yyyy"
}
```

or multiple formats as:

```
"open_day":{
  "type": "date",
  "format":"dd-MM-yyyy||dd/MM/yyyy||MM-dd-yyyy||MM/dd/yyyy"
}
```

if you create mapping as follows:

```
PUT universities
{
  "mappings" :{
    "properties" :{
      "name":{
        "type":"text"
      },
      "telephone_number":{
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "contact_email":{
        "type": "keyword"
      },
      "open_day":{
        "type": "date",
        "format":"dd-MM-yyyy||dd/MM/yyyy||MM-dd-yyyy||MM/dd/yyyy"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

you can insert the following documents with different date formats:

```
# dd-MM-yyyy
PUT universities/_doc/1
{
  "name":"University of A",
  "telephone_number":"01865270000",
  "contact_email":"info@a.edu.au",
  "open_day":"02-09-2022"
}

# dd/MM/yyyy
PUT universities/_doc/2
{
  "name":"University of B",
  "telephone_number":"01865280000",
  "contact_email":"info@b.edu.au",
  "open_day":"02/09/2022"
}

# MM-dd-yyyy
PUT universities/_doc/3
{
  "name":"University of C",
  "telephone_number":"01865290000",
  "contact_email":"info@c.edu.au",
  "open_day":"09-02-2022"
}

# MM/dd/yyyy
PUT universities/_doc/4
{
  "name":"University of D",
  "telephone_number":"01865210000",
  "contact_email":"info@d.edu.au",
  "open_day":"09/02/2022"
}
```

list the document by id 

```
# get document by the id of the document
GET universities/_doc/2
# get field type
GET universities/_mapping/field/name
```



The following table describes he default behavior of the various field types:

| Field Type | Searchable | Analyzed | Returnable | Sortable |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------- | ---------- | -------- |
| Text       | Yes        | Yes      | No         | No       |
| Keyword    | Yes        | No       | No         | Yes      |
| Numeric    | Yes        | No       | No         | Yes      |
| Boolean    | Yes        | No       | No         | Yes      |
| Date       | Yes        | No       | No         | Yes      |

Structured data, such as codes, bank accounts, or phone numbers, are represented by the `keyword` data type.Elasticsearch provides five integer types to handle integer numbers: `byte`, `short`, `integer`, `long`, and `unsigned_long`.

```
# create a index mappings
PUT employees
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "level": {
        "type": "byte"
      },
      "age": {
        "type": "short"
      },
      "employee_id": {
        "type": "integer"
      },
      "salary": {
        "type": "float"
      },
      "pyg":{
        "type": "boolean"
      }
    }
  }
}

# add a document to the created index
PUT employees/_doc/1
{
    "name":"John Smith",
    "employee_id":1234567,
    "level":4,
    "age":21,
    "salary": 156000.56,
    "pyg": true
}

# list the contents of the index
GET employees/_search
```

### Declaring Multi-Types

Let‚Äôs look at the example schema definition that creates our single field `title` with multiple data types (text, keyword, and completion):

```
PUT movies
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "title":{
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {
          "kw":{ "type":"keyword" },
          "comp":{ "type":"completion" }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> The `completion` suggester provides auto-complete/search-as-you-type functionality. This is a navigational feature to guide users to relevant results as they are typing, improving search precision.

output schema is

```json
{
  "movies": {
    "mappings": {
      "properties": {
        "title": {
          "type": "text",
          "fields": {
            "comp": {
              "type": "completion",
              "analyzer": "simple",

### Geo Point Data Type

Location data is expressed as a `geo_point` data type, which represents longitude and latitude values on a map. You can use this to pinpoint an address for a restaurant, a school, a golf course, and others.

The code below creates the schema definition of a `schools` index with two fields: `name` and an `address`. Note that the `address` field is defined as a `geo_point` data type:

```
PUT schools
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "name":{
        "type": "text"
      },
      "address":{
        "type": "geo_point"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

field is expected to be set with a pair of latitude and longitude data:

```
PUT schools/_doc/1
{
  "name":"School of Coding",
  "address":"51.5145, 0.1595"
}
```

you can provide the coordinates as an array or in GeoJSON format or Well-Known-Text (WKT) formats:

```json
# Latitude and longitude as an object:
PUT schools/_doc/2
{
  "name":"School of Science",
  "address":{
    "lat":"51.5145",
    "lon":"0.1595"
  }
}

# Latitude and longitude as an Array 
# (note the order of values - they are lon and lat):

PUT schools/_doc/3
{
  "name":"School of Arts",
  "address":[0.1595, 51.5145]
}
```

Elasticsearch provides the `Object` data type to hold such hierarchical data

```
PUT employees
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "name": {
        "type": "text"
      },
      "address": {
        "type": "object", 
        "properties": {
          "house_number": {
            "type": "text"
          },
          "street": {
            "type": "text"
          },
          "city": {
            "type": "text"
          },
          "postcode": {
            "type": "text"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> However, note that by default every object in Elasticsearch is an `object` type, so this declaration is redundant.

Document samples:

```
PUT employees/_doc/1
{
  "name":"John Smith",
  "address":{
    "house_number":"321",
    "street":"Beta Street",
    "city":"Sydney",
    "postcode":"2000"
  }
}

PUT employees/_doc/2
{
  "name":"Grace Smith",
  "address":{
    "house_number":"123A",
    "street":"Alpha Street",
    "city":"Sydney",
    "postcode":"2000"
  }
}

PUT employees/_doc/3
{
  "name":"Simon Stud",
  "address":{
    "house_number":"82",
    "street":"Karma way",
    "city":"Hornsby",
    "postcode":"2077"
  }
}
```

if you want to return all the employees live in Sydney, notice the propertiy is `address.city`:

```
GET employees/_search
{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "address.city": "Sydney"
    }
  }
}
```

## Joins

Every document that gets indexed is independent and maintains no relationship with any others in that index. Elasticsearch de-normalizes the data to achieve speed and gain performance during indexing and search operations. Elasticsearch provides a `join` data type to consider parent-child relationships should you need them.

You need to create an index mentioning the teacher-student relationship. The hard part is understanding this schema definition, so let's take it a bit slow here.

```
PUT teachers
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "relationship":{
        "type": "join",
        "relations":{
          "teacher":"student" 
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

As we have the schema definition for teacher-student relationship indexed, let's create a teacher:

```
PUT teachers/_doc/1
{
  "name":"Ruth Randall",
  "relationship":{
    "name":"teacher"
  }
}
```

Now that the teacher is ready, let's attach some students.

Let's index two students, both attached to teacher Ruth. Make sure that the relationship declared via name is student. You also need to provide the routing with a key (we are using `ruth` as the key). The routing key for all students must be same key:

```
PUT teachers/_doc/2?routing=ruth
{
  "name":"John Smith",
  "relationship":{
    "name":"student",
    "parent":1
  }
}

PUT teachers/_doc/3?routing=ruth
{
  "name":"Angela Krishnan",
  "relationship":{
    "name":"student",
    "parent":1
  }
}
```

The `relationship` object should have the value set as `student` (remember the parent-child portion of the `relations` attribute in the schema?) and the `parent` should be assigned a document identifier of the associated teacher (ID 1), Ruth in our example.

```
#Search
GET teachers/_search
{
  "query": {
    "parent_id":{
      "type":"student",
      "id":1
    }
  }
}
```

This will return all the students of teacher `Ruth`.

 

## Bulk

The `_bulk` API consists of a specific syntax with a POST method invoking the API call. Let's first see the query and check the details.

When you run the following query in Kibana->Dev Tools:

```
POST _bulk
{"index":{"_index":"movies","_id":"1"}}
{"title": "Top Gun Maverick","actors": "Tom Cruise"} 
{"index":{"_index":"movies","_id":"2"}}
{"title": "Mission Impossible","actors": "Tom Cruise"}
```

output is

```
{
  "took" : 132,
  "errors" : false,
  "items" : [
    {
      "index" : {
        "_index" : "movies",
        "_id" : "1",
        "_version" : 1,
        "result" : "created",
        "_shards" : {
          "total" : 2,
          "successful" : 1,
          "failed" : 0
        },
        "_seq_no" : 0,
        "_primary_term" : 1,
        "status" : 201
      }
    },
    {
      "index" : {
        "_index" : "movies",
        "_id" : "2",
        "_version" : 1,
        "result" : "created",
        "_shards" : {
          "total" : 2,
          "successful" : 1,
          "failed" : 0
        },
        "_seq_no" : 1,
        "_primary_term" : 1,
        "status" : 201
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The request body consists of two lines for every document that needs to be stored:

- The first line indicates the action and the metadata. In this case we are indexing a document (hence "index") with ID 1 into an index called `movies`.
- The second line is the document itself‚ÄîNDJSON (short for "new line delimited JSON") representation of the data. The document is formatted in JSON and added in the new line to the request.

> NOTE: We can also perform other actions, such as `create`, `update`, and `delete`.
>
> ```
> {"delete":{"_index":"movies","_id":"1"}}
> ```
>
> you wish to delete the document with ID 1, above is the first line will look like. You don't need a second line to delte.

Let's index a bunch of Tom Cruise's movies using the `_bulk` API, but this time we won't supply IDs for the movies:

```
POST movies/_bulk
{"index":{}} 
{"title": "Mission Impossible","release_date": "1996-07-05"}
{"index":{}} 
{"title": "Mission Impossible II","release_date": "2000-05-24"}
{"index":{}} 
{"title": "Mission Impossible III","release_date": "2006-05-03"}
{"index":{}} 
{"title": "Mission Impossible - Ghost Protocol","release_date": "2011-12-26"}
```

Two things to note from the previous query:

- The request has an index name (`movies`) mentioned in the URL rather than from the first line
- No `ID` is provided for the document

### Bulk Create

Let's index some documents and try out `create` action.

> NOTE: The `create` action allows an additional check when indexing the document; that is, the action doesn't replace an existing document.

The following code snippet creates new tv shows using the `create` action and bulk API:

```
POST _bulk
{"create":{"_index":"tv_shows","_id":"1"}} 
{"title": "Man vs Bee","actors":"Rowan Atkinson","release_date": "2022-06-24"}
{"create":{"_index":"tv_shows","_id":"2"}} 
{"title": "Killing Eve","actors":["Jodie Comer","Sandra Oh"],"release_date": "2018-04-08"}
{"create":{"_index":"tv_shows","_id":"3"}} 
{"title": "Peaky Blinders","actors":"Cillian Murphy","release_date": "2013-09-12"}
```

the output is

```

NOTE: All the lines should be terminated by new line character `\n`.

## Text Analysis

The analyzer is a software module tasked with two functions[^6]: 

1. tokenization: the process of splitting sentences into individual words 
2. normalization: where the tokens (words) are massaged, transformed, modified, and enriched in the form of stemming, synonyms, stop words, and other features 

> The `text` fields are thoroughly analyzed and stored in inverted indexes for advanced query matching.

*Stemming* is an operation where words are reduced (stemmed) to their root words (for example, ‚Äúauthor‚Äù is the root word for ‚Äúauthors‚Äù, ‚Äúauthoring‚Äù, and ‚Äúauthored‚Äù).

Normalization also finds *synonyms* and adding them to the inverted index. For example, ‚Äúauthor‚Äù may have additional synonyms, such as ‚Äúwordsmith‚Äù, ‚Äúnovelist‚Äù, ‚Äúwriter‚Äù, and so on.

The *Stop words* are such as English grammar articles they are irrelevant to find the relevant documents.
