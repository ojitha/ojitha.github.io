## Data Lineage

```mermaid
mindmap
  (("Lineage"))
    ["Coarse
    Grained"]
      ["Propagate across
      Storage Tiers"]
        ["ETL"]
    ["Fine
    Grained"]
      ["Column 
      level"]
```



- Coarse-grained: This data lineage often targets business users, focuses on capturing the high-level business processes and overall data workflows. Typically, it captures and visualises the relationships between datasets and how theyâ€™re propagated across storage tiers, including ETL jobs and operational information. 
- Fine-grained: This data lineage gives access to column-level lineage and the data transformation steps in the processing and analytical pipelines.

You can use the [Spline agent](https://github.com/AbsaOSS/spline-spark-agent) to capture runtime lineage information from Spark jobs, powered by [AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/). For those interested in lineage tracking for workloads combining graph data and machine learning, Amazon Web Services announced [Amazon SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/lineage-tracking.html) at re: Invent 2021[^1].

SageMaker ML Lineage Tracking integrates with [SageMaker Pipelines](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/), creates and stores information about the steps of automated ML workflows from data preparation to model deployment.



## Partitioning

**Data skew** in partitioning occurs when your data is not evenly distributed across partitions, resulting in some partitions holding significantly more records (or bytes) than others.

- **Adaptive Partitioning**: Dynamically adjust partitioning based on data characteristics to ensure a more balanced distribution.
- **Salting**: Introduce a random factor or "salt" to the data to distribute randomly across partitions.
- **Repartitioning**
- **Sampling**: Using a sample, determine the distribution and adjust the processing strategy accordingly.
- **Custom partitioning**: involves partitioning based on domain knowledge, ensuring better distribution.
