## Productivity Tools
Productivity is a cross cutting concren each and very bit of work I do. 

### Diagraming tools
I was very enthustic to know markdown level diagraming. 

One of the best so far found is [mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) which I cause use with the my blog tool stackedit.io. For example:

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
</div>

such a great diagraming.
