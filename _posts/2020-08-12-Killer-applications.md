I was wonder what are the applications drive to sold out computer hardware. one of the well known is [VisiCalc](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwips_aVpY3rAhVFOSsKHXYNBkgQFjAKegQIGRAF&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FVisiCalc&usg=AOvVaw1PHmv_0dQ63Vfok0SV_vn0)

People spent around 10,000 USD to run 100 USD software. As well, in 90s PHP and JSP are the killer applications to create Dynamic HTMLS before Ruby take the market over Rails. C lang became propular over assembly langauge and dominated system programming.

Sun has learn from Apple and invested around 500M USD on Java marketing in 2003. First time such a huge investment on a launge. This has drove both Java and JavaScript in the market. Still there are killer application trentds. The fuctional language like [Elm](https://elm-lang.org) try to replace the CCS in web application segment.

CoffeeScript, TypeScript are effort to replace JavaScript. This is the first time I saw langauge try to replace another language in the same paradigm. But stil the killer app for browser scripting is JavaScript.
