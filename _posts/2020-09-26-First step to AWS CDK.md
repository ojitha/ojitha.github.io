First, you have to verify that, you have installed the AWS CDK.
1. in the macOS, install AWS CLI using Homebrew
2. install NodeJS
3. install AWS CDK using NodeJS

If all the above is good, now install the python enviroment to use with the AWS SDK:
1. install Python version 3 
2. create virtual enviroment `p3` using pyenv tool 
3. You can use any directory to creat your scripts, I use Visual Studio Code as my editor
4. In case, I can use the following command to set the shell to python version 3:

```bash
pyenv shell p3
```
