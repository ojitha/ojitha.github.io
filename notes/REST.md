## Richardson Maturity Model

1. Level 0: Swamp of POX
    - Use HTTP to tunnel through. Ex: SOAP, XML-RPC
    - Usually use HTTP POST
2. Level 1: Resources
    - Multiple URIs to distinguish releated nouns. Ex: /person/1
3. Level 2: HTTP Verbs
    - Leverage transport-native properties to enhance service.
    - Use idimatic HTTP controls like status codes and headers
4. Level 3: Hypermedia Controls (HATEOAS)
    - No a prior knowledge of service required. Navigation is provided by service and hypermodia controls.
    - Promotes longevity through a uniform interface.

## GitHub REST access
Before accessing the GitHub API[^1], it is better to authenticate first to increase the rate limit. You can get the access token from the GitHub App.

Before running the following REST access, I've exported the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable.

```bash
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/repos/ojitha/learn-ai" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN"
```

If you are passing JWT, you must use `Authorization: Bearer`.

GitHub recommends using the built-in `GITHUB_TOKEN` instead of creating a token (what I did above is not the recommended way).
{:.warning}



Above command, you can run in the Powershell as follows

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Method GET -Uri "https://api.github.com/repos/ojitha/learn-ai" -Headers @{
    "Accept" = "application/vnd.github+json"
    "Authorization" = "Bearer $env:GITHUB_TOKEN"
}
```



```bash
curl --request GET \
--url "https://api.github.com/events?per_page=2&page=1" \
--header "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
--header "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
  https://api.github.com/events

```



## Monitoring network traffic



### tcpdump

Network interfaces are built to perform filtering, not to overwhelm the receiving operating system. They check the media access control (MAC) address in the frame's destination[^2]. 

The frame is the *layer two headers* for communication on the local, physical network. If the destination MAC address (belongs to IP) matches the address associated with the network interface (the physical address), the associated packet is forwarded to the OS. 

> To run tcpdump, you need sudo access.

Berkeley Packet Filters (BPF) to limit. BPF is a simple language that indicates elements of packets you want to filter on.

For example, if you want see only the network traffic for the GitHub API

```bash
sudo tcpdump host 4.237.22.34
```

Use the `nslookup api.github.io` to get the above IP address. Only for soruce or destination use `src` or `dst` instead of `host`.

### tshark

You can use the tshark same as above

```bash
sudo tshark host 4.237.22.34
```

To display only certain fields in tshark, you can use the switch `-Tfields`[^3].

```bash
tshark -Tfields -e ip.src
```

At a high level, 

1. When initiating a TCP connection between a client and server, the client sends the server a "SYN" request, asking for a connection to be established. 
2. Once the server has processed the response, a "SYN-ACK" response is sent back to the client, acknowledging it has been received. 
3. The client answers with an "ACK," and once the server has received it, communication has been established. This three-phase sequence of events is called the TCP 3-way handshake.

### nmap

To install

```bash
sudo apt install nmap -y
```

*TCP Connect Scan* uses the full TCP 3-way handshake to establish a connection to a host and see what ports are: 

| State           | Explantation                                                 |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open            | Service that is accepting TCP, UDP, SCTP packets.            |
| Closed          | A port with no active service taking requests.               |
| Filtered        | Unable to differentiate as the packets are being filtered, preventing the probes from reaching the port. |
| Open/Filtered   | Unable to determine between Open or Filtered and occurs when open ports typically do not give a response. |
| Closed/Filtered | Unable to determine between Closed or Filtered.              |

```bash
nmap -sT 4.237.22.34
```
